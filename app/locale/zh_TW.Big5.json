    "SAFE_TO_USE_QUESTION": "Lantern 使用上安全嗎?",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1": "Lantern takes great pains to ensure that users are safe, but there are cases we cannot protect against, so users need to be aware of how they can use Lantern safely. For users in censored regions itʼs extremely important that you only choose Lantern friends who you really trust. Your Internet traffic will run through those peers. If you add people who you donʼt trust, you run the risk of adding a user who could be monitoring you. So <b>only add Lantern friends that you really trust</b>. Beyond that, <b>Lantern will also send your traffic through peers up to four degrees away from you</b>, that is, friends of friends of friends of friends. We do this to build a more connected, scalable network, as users often don’t directly know anyone on the other side of the censorship divide. However, every additional link in the chain exposes you to a less and less trusted user (i.e. you trust your friends’ friends less than you trust your friends). Always keep in mind that <b>Lantern is a tool to provide access, it is not designed to prevent monitoring</b>.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_2": "<b>Lantern is not an anonymity tool.</b> If you require that the sites you visit do not learn your IP address or physical location (they normally can, which may come as a surprise), or you cannot risk network monitors being able to determine what sites you visit, we recommend you use <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tor</a>. Tor is great software, and we communicate with the Tor team frequently. Again, Lantern’s purpose is access. Tor’s purpose is anonymity.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_3": "One last point on safety: With any tool, including both Lantern and Tor, you should never post sensitive content to a web site that is hosted in a region where the government pursues people who post such content, especially if you live there. This is because a global network observer like the government can identify you as the user who uploaded that content and will be able to geolocate you.",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_QUESTION": "Lantern 收集什麼個人資訊?",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_ANSWER_1": "請參閱 Lantern 的<a href='https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Privacy' target='_blank'>隱私權政策</a>。",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_ANSWER_2": "<a href='https://docs.google.com/a/getlantern.org/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ap6nn0WEcFTRdHUtTm9GcFpsNFpoOGFXQlBfODN4TkE&single=true&gid=0&output=html' target='_blank'>Lantern 資訊披露表</a>確切的說明了什麼是追蹤，以及目的為何。",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_QUESTION": "當無法獲得任何使用者提供的存取時，Lantern 又是如何運作?",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_1": "為了幫助建立 Lantern 網路，我們開始設置 <a href=\"https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Lantern-Cloud-Servers\" target=\"_blank\">Lantern 雲端伺服器</a>。這些伺服器是給沒有使用者提供存取時的代理備援。我們希望隨著 Lantern 網路茁壯，將會有足夠使用者提供存取，如此一來我們將會需要越來越少的備援伺服器。",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_2": "我們的其它計畫是給人們另一個選項，即贊助更多的 Lantern 雲端伺服器，為他們及他們的好友所專用。我們也希望與那些有空餘運算能量及想幫助網路自由的公司作夥伴關係，捐助伺服器給 Lantern 網路。",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_QUESTION": "Lantern 與其它工具有何不同?",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_1": "Lanternʼs goal is to give users access while being fast, secure, and easy to use. <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tor</a> is another tool which is sometimes used for censorship circumvention, but Torʼs purpose is anonymity; circumvention is just a possible side effect. Because of this, Tor can be relatively slow to surf the web. For cases when anonymity is not necessary, Lantern provides an alternative with faster access. Compared to other tools aimed at access (GoAgent, Freegate, Ultrasurf, Psiphon, Autoproxy) Lanternʼs strength is the ease with which it can be installed and used, as well as its trusted peer-to-peer network architecture designed to scale in the presence of censors.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_2": "By default, Lantern runs as a system proxy, which means that browsers on your computer will use it automatically, without your having to change any of their settings. Some other tools only work with one specific browser, or require complex configuration.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_3": "Another unique aspect in Lanternʼs design is its peer-to-peer architecture, which allows data to come from many computers at once, rather than a single server. Peer-to-peer architectures also allow networks to scale to millions of users at a fraction of the cost of more centralized architectures.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_4": "Recently, the Lantern team has contributed to <a href=\"https://www.uproxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">uProxy</a>, a new effort sponsored by Google Ideas. While there are similarities between the two, there are also some important differences. For one, Lantern is an independent app that stays running in the background, while uProxy is a browser extension, and currently requires asking a single friend to proxy for you on a per-session basis, so with Lantern you can have many peers give you access at the same time as opposed to just one. Another difference is Lantern allows friends of friends up to 4 degrees away to connect to one another, whereas uProxy only allows direct friends. Finally, to be faster and more blocking resistant, by default Lantern proxies access only to a specific set of sites you configure (see below), whereas uProxy reroutes traffic to all sites through your uProxy peer while you have it enabled.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_QUESTION": "為何 Lantern 不預設代理所有網站?",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_1": "Lantern uses a proxied sites list for a couple reasons. The primary reason is efficiency. It is always faster to go to a site directly rather than through a proxy, even when you can use many proxies simultaneously. So sites that arenʼt blocked will be fastest if they are reached directly instead of through Lantern.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_2": "The second reason is that, to a censor watching your activity, your traffic will look more like it would if you werenʼt running a circumvention tool. So instead of seeing you making encrypted connections to only one or a handful of computers outside the country (i.e. the Lantern users giving you access), a censor will see you also connecting to all the sites not on your list directly, just as when you arenʼt running Lantern. So proxying only blocked sites helps that traffic blend in with all your other traffic.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_QUESTION": "信任網路如何運作? 將他人設為 Lantern 好友會發生什麼事?",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is built on a trust network. This network connects people who trust one another to share internet connections. When you and another user are Lantern friends with one another, you can proxy traffic for one another using Lantern. However, if Lantern proxied only through direct friends, users would often have no proxies available whenever none of their direct friends were online giving access.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_2": "To mitigate this, Lantern users getting access can discover a subset of the users giving access up to 4 degrees away from them in the trust network. So for instance, if you use Lantern to get access, your brother’s partner’s mother’s friend could end up proxying your Lantern traffic. If this person is a censor, she could block or analyze your traffic. On the other hand, if you use Lantern to read or post something private or sensitive, it will look as though this traffic is coming from her computer. Because of this, everyone running Lantern should only friend people they trust, and <b>only use Lantern to proxy traffic that is not private or sensitive</b>.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_3": "By only adding people you trust, you protect not only yourself, but also your friends, their friends, their friendsʼ friends, and so on. And by allowing users to discover a subset of users farther away from them in the trust network, Lantern increases available proxies while maintaining blocking resistance.",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_QUESTION": "如何下載 Lantern?",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is no longer accepting requests for invitations. In order to protect Lantern against infiltration by censors, all invitations are now made by friends to friends.  If you know and trust someone who is already using Lantern, please contact them to request an invitation.",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_QUESTION": "我位於未實施審查的地區，也不知道在審查區域的任何使用者。我仍然幫得上忙嗎?",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_ANSWER_1": "當然可以！在實施審查區域的人們仍然可以透過您的朋友了解您。所以您不直接認識位於審查區域的任何人，而你朋友可能會，甚至他們的朋友會，以此類推。如果您持續執行 Lantern，並加入您信任的人們，最終您會與需要存取的使用者連線。<b>這就是為什麼邀請好友加入 Lantern 如此重要。</b>這增加了您幫助審查區域使用者的機會。",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_QUESTION": "好的，我已安裝 Lantern 了。下一步該如何?",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "對於在未實施審查區域的使用者安裝 Lantern 後，有兩件您需要做的事：",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_2": "<strong>&mdash; 盡可能多使用 Lantern.</strong>",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_3": "<strong>&mdash; 將信任的使用者加入 Lantern 好友。</strong>",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_4": "每當您執行 Lantern，您建立新的存取節點，使在審查區域的使用者能夠存取開放網路。記住，只有在您 Lantern 網路內的人才可以與您連線。這就是為何第二個步驟非常關鍵。您的 Lantern 網路越大，就越有機會提供存取給需要的使用者。<b>所以請盡量邀請許多信任的連絡人！</b>",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_QUESTION": "Lantern 會使我的電腦容易受到駭客攻擊嗎?",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_ANSWER_1": "Lantern takes a number of precautions to make sure users are safe. First, Lantern does not allow anyone it connects you to to read the contents of your computer. It simply allows you to share Internet connections. The data passing between you is encrypted so that no intermediaries (e.g. your government or Internet service provider or theirs) can read it. Lantern also requires mutual authentication for all connections, which means that Lantern will only allow users to connect to you that it can verify are in your Lantern network, and not just anyone.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_QUESTION": "Lantern 是免費的嗎? 執行它會產生什麼花費?",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_1": "Lantern 是免費的，也是自由的：根據<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/getlantern/lantern/master/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\">授權條款</a>，自由的使用、修改和再發佈。.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_2": "If your Internet connection is limited, then giving access through Lantern will count against your limit. We recommend using Lantern with unlimited Internet connections.",
