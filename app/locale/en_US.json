    "HOW_LANTERN_WORKS": "How Lantern Works",
    "LANTERN_PARAGRAPH_1": "Lantern's main goal is access - getting fast, reliable connections to the open internet. Most tools that provide access in blocked regions require a server. With Lantern every single computer can act as a server. By installing and running Lantern, users in uncensored countries provide information gateways for those in censored regions. Users in censored regions connecting through Lantern quickly access web sites like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube that were once blocked.",
    "LANTERN_PARAGRAPH_2": "At the core of Lantern is the 'trust network.' Users invite their friends in order to build the sharing network. By only inviting contacts that they know, everyone works together to grow the network and to resist blocking by censors. The more trusted friends you have, the faster and more reliable the internet connection. Lantern is still in development, please enter your email address for an invitation to the private beta.",

    "SAFE_TO_USE_QUESTION": "Is Lantern safe for me to use?",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1-1": "Lantern takes great pains to ensure that users are safe, but there are cases we cannot protect against, so users need to be aware of how they can use Lantern safely. For users in censored regions it's extremely important that you only choose Lantern friends who you really trust. Your Internet traffic will run through those peers. If you add people who you don't trust, you run the risk of adding a user who could be monitoring you. So ",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1-2": "only add Lantern friends who you really trust. ",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1-3": "Beyond that, ",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1-4": "Lantern will also send your traffic through peers up to four degrees away from you ",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1-5": "-- friends of friends of friends of friends. We do this to build a network that can scale, as users often don’t know people on the other side of the censorship divide. However, every additional link in the chain exposes you to a less and less trusted user (you typically trust your friends’ friends less than you trust your friends). Always keep in mind that Lantern is a tool to provide access, and it is not designed to prevent monitoring. In the future we’ll likely add options to configure the degrees away in the trust graph you’re willing to have Lantern use, but that’s not in this version.", 
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_2-1": "Lantern is not designed to be an anonymity tool. ",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_2-2": "If you require that the websites you visit do not learn your physical location (they normally can, which may come as a surprise!) or you cannot risk network monitors being able to determine what web sites you visit, we recommend you use ",
    "TOR": "Tor",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_2-3": ". Tor is great software, and we communicate with the Tor team frequently. Lantern is much more focused on access whereas Tor’s goal is anonymity.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_3": "One last point on safety: with any tool, including both Lantern and Tor, you should never post sensitive content to a web site that is hosted in your country if you live in a censoring region. The reason is simple: a global network observer, such as the government, will be able to identify you as the user who uploaded that content and will be able to geo-locate you. This is probably the most dangerous thing you could do, so make particularly sure you're posting to sites hosted outside of the country if you think that content could be controversial in some way.",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_QUESTION": "How does Lantern work if I can't reach any users giving access?",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_1-1": "To help get the Lantern network started we have set up '",
    "LANTERN_CLOUD_SERVERS": "Lantern Cloud Servers",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_1-2": "'. These are dedicated servers that serve as a 'fallback' to proxy user traffic if no one else is available. Users with no connections will make use of these. We know this approach is not scalable, as it would end up costing tons of money. Lantern is built with a unique algorithm that lets you make use of connections of friends of friends, up to four 'hops' away - friends of friends of friends of friends. Our hope is that the social network grows dense enough that there is very little load on the fallback servers. When there gets to be too many people we will likely throttle the connections, so that people who do make good connections get faster access.",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_2": "Our other plan is to give people an option to buy or donate additional Lantern Cloud Servers. People in censored countries who know no one outside, or just want a reliable connection, could sponsor a server for just themselves or their friends. We hope to eventually let people sign up for free servers like Google App Engine as well. We also hope to partner with companies that have spare computing capacity and want to help internet freedom by donating virtual servers to run Lantern and add more Lantern Cloud Servers to the pool.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_QUESTION": "How does Lantern compare to other tools?",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_1": "Lantern's main focus is access, with a big emphasis on usability. Tor is one of the most popular tools in this space, but their primary focus is anonymity. Because of this, Tor can be relatively slow to surf the web. For those who do not care about being completely anonymous, Lantern provides an alternative with faster access. Compared to the other tools aimed at access (GoAgent, Freegate, Ultrasurf, Psiphon, Autoproxy) Lantern's strength is the ease with which it can be installed and used. It is designed to just work without having to understand what a proxy is.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_2": "Lantern is also a bit different in that it runs as a system proxy, meaning any program you run will automatically use the proxy. Other programs will only work with the browser, or take complex configuration. Since Lantern adjusts the core system every program works more naturally. Lantern also only proxies the sites that you configure it for, so sites that are not blocked are not run through the proxy. VPN's and others generally run all your traffic through the proxy.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_3": "The other unique thing about Lantern is its peer-to-peer approach, which can make downloading faster because data comes from many computers at once, not just one server. This also makes it so it can eventually handle millions of users without costing a fortune, since it just needs spare bandwidth from any computer, instead of specialized servers running.",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_4": "Recently, the Lantern team has been contributing to UProxy, a new effort sponsored by Google Ideas. While there are similarities in the P2P approach, Lantern is a separate software program that runs in the background. The plan for UProxy is for it to work as a browser extension.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_QUESTION": "Why does Lantern not proxy every site by default?",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_1": "Lantern relies on its configured proxied site list for a couple reasons. One is efficiency. Though Lantern is designed to be fast, it is always more faster to go to the site directly than to go through a proxy, or even a bunch of peer proxies. So sites that aren't blocked will be fastest if they are reached directly instead of through Lantern.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_2": "The second is that it potentially helps mask the traffic more. Instead of seeing a user always connect to a handful of special locations (users in their Lantern network giving access), a censor will see them accessing sites that aren't blocked directly, the same patterns as when they aren't running Lantern. So proxying only what is blocked helps that traffic blend in with everything a user is doing.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_QUESTION": "How does this 'trust network' work? What happens when I add someone as a Lantern friend?",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is built on an extended trust network. This network consists of people who chose to trust each other as Lantern friends. These friends can proxy traffic directly through each other using Lantern. However, if Lantern proxied only through immediate friends, users might often not have any proxies available to them because none of their immediate friends are online.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_2": "This is where the “extended” part of the network comes in. Lantern tells everyone’s friends about a few* of their other friends, allowing friends of friends to proxy for each other. This “advertisement” of friends proceeds to 4 degrees of separation, such that Joe’s brother’s girlfriend’s mother’s chiropractor Jane could end up proxying Joe’s internet traffic.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_3": "If Jane is a censor, this puts her in a position to block or analyze Joe’s traffic. Conversely, if Joe is using Lantern to do something illegal (like download child pornography), it will look to the outside world as though Jane is doing these things. Because of this, it’s important that everyone in the network, including Joe, his brother, his girlfriend and her mother all add only people they trust to their list of Lantern friends.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_4": "By being careful about adding only trustworthy Lantern friends, you protect not only yourself but your friends and a lot of other people who depend on Lantern.",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_5": "by only telling friends about a few of their other friends, Lantern achieves a level of blocking resistance that would not otherwise be possible.",
    "RESISTANT_TO_BLOCKING_QUESTION": "How does the trust network make Lantern resistant to blocking?",
    "RESISTANT_TO_BLOCKING_ANSWER": "",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_QUESTION": "How do I download Lantern?",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_ANSWER": "Lantern is still in development. You can sign up for an invitation to our private beta.",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_QUESTION": "I live in an uncensored region and don't know anyone in a censored region. Can I still help?",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_ANSWER_1-1": "Definitely! People in censored regions can still learn about you through your friends. So while you don't know anyone directly living in censored regions, your friends might, and they'll relay your information to their trusted friends in censored regions. ",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_ANSWER_1-2": "That's why it's really important to invite your friends to Lantern. ",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_ANSWER_1-3": "It maximizes the likelihood that your social network will reach into censored regions so you can actually help!",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_QUESTION": "OK, I've installed Lantern. Now what?",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "For users in uncensored regions, there are two basic things you can do once you've installed Lantern:",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_2": "Run Lantern as much as possible",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_3": "Invite more users",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_4-1": "Whenever you run Lantern, you create a new access point users in censored regions can use to access the open Internet. Remember, though, not everyone can access the Internet through you -- only people in your extended trust network (direct trusted contacts also running Lantern, or their extended trusted contacts). That's why the second part is equally as important -- the more people you invite, the more likely you are to become an available access point for users in censored regions. ",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_4-2": "So please invite as many trusted contacts as you can!",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_QUESTION": "Will Lantern make my computer vulnerable to hackers?",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_ANSWER": "Lantern takes a number of precautions to make sure users are safe. First, Lantern does not allow any external computers to access your hard drive. Instead, Lantern simply acts as a conduit for your trusted contacts, relaying their requests to web pages on the open Internet as well as the replies from those web pages. External users have no access to your computer itself. Lantern also requires what's called mutual authentication for all connections, requiring that anyone connecting through you to the open Internet is someone you have a cryptographic key for, so someone who has learned about your computer through either being a trusted contact directly or through one of your trusted contacts. This ensures that not just anyone can connect to you through Lantern, but only people in your extended Lantern network.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_QUESTION": "Is Lantern free? Will running it cost me anything?",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_1-1": "Lantern is free as in money and as in freedom: free to use, modify, and redistribute in accordance with its ",
    "LICENSE": "license",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_1-2": ". This documentation is likewise distributed under a ",
    "FREE_LICENSE": "free license.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_2": "Running Lantern on your home or work network will not cost anything. If you connect primarily through a mobile data plan then Lantern can increase your bandwidth (as your trusted Lantern friends use your connection to get to the open internet). We recommend only using Lantern on unmetered Internet accounts.",
