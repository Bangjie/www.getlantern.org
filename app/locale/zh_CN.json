    "SAFE_TO_USE_QUESTION": "Lantern安全性如何？",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_1": "Your Internet surfing is relatively safe with Lantern but it’s important to remember the following:",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_2": "<strong>&mdash; HTTPS</strong>: Remember to always use use HTTPS and ideally to install the <a href='https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere' target='_blank'>HTTPS Everywhere browser extension</a>, because then your traffic is always encrypted and not viewable by anyone regardless of how you are accessing the Internet. As an added bonus Lantern doesn’t allow for false HTTPS certificates.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_3": "<strong>&mdash; Peers</strong>: A portion of all Lantern traffic is handled by peer proxies.  It is possible for censors and other untrusted 3rd parties to run these peer proxies.  You can prevent them from viewing the content of your traffic by using HTTPS, though the sites that you visit will be viewable by them.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_4": "<strong>&mdash; Cookies + Privacy</strong>: Lantern does prevent other sites from seeing your IP, though it cannot prevent proxies (either peers or cloud servers) from seeing your IP.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_5": "<strong>&mdash; IP addresses</strong>:  If you require that no one sees your IP address or physical location (they typically can, which may come as a surprise), then you might have a better chance in improving your privacy with <a target='_blank' href='https://www.torproject.org'>Tor</a>.",
    "SAFE_TO_USE_ANSWER_6": "<strong>&mdash; Which tool is right for me?</strong>: In determining which tool to use, if speed and reliability of service are most important to you, Lantern is your tool. If you can tolerate slower speeds to post sensitive information on the Internet, you may want to use Tor.",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_QUESTION": "Lantern收集什么个人信息？",
    "PRIVACY_INFO_ANSWER_1": "Lantern allows users to provide the Lantern team with useful debugging information as well as analytics, which you can configure in your Lantern settings. If you choose to send Lantern that data, we will not use it for any other purpose other than providing the Lantern service to you and others.",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_QUESTION": "当我无法连上任何提供连接的用户时，Lantern如何工作？",
    "CANT_REACH_USERS_ANSWER_1": "To help get the Lantern network started we have set up <a href=\"https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Lantern-Cloud-Servers\" target=\"_blank\">Lantern Cloud Servers</a>. These channel a significant amount of traffic. This ensures a higher reliability of service by having a variety of sources for Internet access",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_QUESTION": "Lantern跟其他工具比较有何特点？",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_1": "Lantern的目标是给用户提供快速，安全和方便的访问互联网的工具。<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tor</a>是另一个工具，用于规避网络审查。他的目的是匿名，翻墙只是一个可能的副产品。因此，用Tor看网页比较慢。匿名不重要的时候，用Lantern比较快。与其他翻墙工具相比（GoAgent，Freegate，Ultrasurf，Psiphon，Autoproxy），Lantern的优点是，即使在存在封锁的情况下，他仍旧容易安装和使用，以及他的信任点对点网络，很容易扩充。",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_2": "在不作任何配置的情况下，Lantern像一个代理一样运行。也就是说，电脑上的浏览器自动使用他，不需要你修改任何设置。一些其他工具只能运行于某种浏览器，或者需要复杂的设置。",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_3": "另一个Lantern的设计特点是他的点对点架构（peer-to-peer），这样它可以让数据同时从很多电脑传过来，而不是从一个单个服务器。点对点架构可以让网络扩大到亿万用户而只花费很少的代价。",
    "COMPARE_TO_OTHER_TOOLS_ANSWER_4": "Recently, the Lantern team has contributed to <a href=\"https://www.uproxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">uProxy</a>, a new effort sponsored by Google Ideas. While there are similarities between the two, there are also some important differences. For one, Lantern is an independent app that stays running in the background, while uProxy is a browser extension, and currently requires asking a single friend to proxy for you on a per-session basis, so with Lantern you can have many peers give you access at the same time as opposed to just one. Another difference is Lantern allows friends of friends up to 4 degrees away to connect to one another, whereas uProxy only allows direct friends. Finally, to be faster and more blocking resistant, by default Lantern proxies access only to a specific set of sites you configure (see below), whereas uProxy reroutes traffic to all sites through your uProxy peer while you have it enabled.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_QUESTION": "What is the Lantern proxied sites list?",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_1": "Lantern only provides access to blocked sites, and it does this through a default proxied sites list. Therefore, if a web site is unblocked, Lantern will get out of the way and use your regular Internet connection to send you directly to that site. That ensures that users are able to see unblocked content as quickly as possible and also that we don’t waste network resources providing access to content that is not blocked in the first place.",
    "PROXY_BY_DEFAULT_ANSWER_2": "If you are not getting access to a blocked site, that does not necessarily mean that Lantern is not working. You may need to add that site to our list of blocked sites to get access. You can do this in the settings or send an email to us at <a target='_blank' href='mailto:team@getlantern.org'>team@getlantern.org</a>",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_QUESTION": "信任圈如何工作？将他人加为好友是什么意思？",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_1": "Lantern是建立在信任网络的基础上，他让相互信任的朋友分享网络连接。当你和另一个使用者相互是Lantern朋友时，你们用Lantern相互代理互联网访问。不过，如果Lantern只通过直接朋友代理，使用者常常会因为没有直接朋友在线，而无法得到代理服务。",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_2": "为了减轻这个，Lantern用户在信任网络中发掘可以提供访问的朋友，最深可达4层。比如，你要用Lantern来访问互联网，是你的哥哥的合伙人的母亲的朋友提供了代理。如果她是个网络审查者，她会封锁或分析你的访问。另一方面，如果你用Lantern阅读或发表私人或敏感信息，就好象是她的电脑在阅读或发表。因此，所有运行Lantern的应该只把它信任的人作为朋友，并且，<b>只使用Lantern来传递非私人和非敏感信息</b>。",
    "TRUST_NETWORK_ANSWER_3": "通过只添加你信任的朋友，你不光保护你自己，也保护了你的朋友，他们的朋友，朋友的朋友，等等。通过容许使用者在信任网络中深入发掘，Lantern增加了可用的代理，并且维护了抵御封锁的能力。",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_QUESTION": "如何下载Lantern？",
    "DOWNLOAD_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "Lantern不再受理邀请请求。为了保护审查对Lantern的渗透，现在所有的邀请都只能在朋友与朋友之间。如果您认识并且信任某个已经在使用Lantern的人，请联系他们获得邀请。",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_QUESTION": "我位于没有网络审查的地区，也不认识位于网络审查地区的人，我能不能提供帮助？",
    "CAN_I_STILL_HELP_ANSWER_1": "Definitely! You can both run Lantern and invite more people to join the cause, even if those people also live in an uncensored region. When you run Lantern, you will be added to our DNS round-robin so that a small portion of overall traffic gets routed through your machine. While Lantern also runs its own servers to ensure a good quality of service, each user helps reduce that burden. <b>Our ultimate goal is to build a system that bypasses censorship even if we cease to exist as a company, and that is only possible if a lot of people run it to create new access points. When you invite more people, they will help lighten the load further for everyone</b>.",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_QUESTION": "Lantern安装完毕，接下来呢？",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_1": "对于在非封锁区的用户，安装Lantern后有两件基础性工作要做：",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_2": "<strong>&mdash; 尽可能多地使用Lantern。</strong>",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_3": "<strong>&mdash; 添加更多的你信任的用户成为 Lantern 朋友。</strong>",
    "INSTALLED_LANTERN_ANSWER_4": "Whenever you run Lantern, you create a new access point users in censored regions can use to access the open Internet. Remember, though, that your own social network is part of what enables Lantern to stay unblocked, so inviting your contacts to join the cause is an important step!",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_QUESTION": "Lantern 会导致我的计算机易受黑客攻击吗？",
    "VULNERABLE_TO_HACKERS_ANSWER_1": "Lantern采取一些措施来确保用户的安全。首先，Lantern不允许连接到你的人查看电脑上的内容。他只是容许他使用你的互联网网络连接。传输的内容是加密的，中间人(政府或网络提供商或其他人) 无法阅读。Lantern还要求所有的连接相互授权，也就是说，只有在你的信任网络中的用户才可以连接到你，而其他人不行。",
    "WHO_ARE_WE_QUESTION": "Who are we?",
    "WHO_ARE_WE_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is built by the Brave New Software Project, Inc, a registered 501c3 non-profit dedicated to using software to tackle tough global challenges. Brave New Software’s founder and Lantern lead developer, Adam Fisk, was formerly a lead developer of the peer-to-peer file sharing services LimeWire and LittleShoot. While working on these P2P architectures, Adam realized they could be useful in providing unfiltered internet access. You can watch some of Adam’s talks about Lantern here and here.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_QUESTION": "Lantern是免费的吗？使用它会产生什么花费？",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_1": "Lantern is a free, open source software. It is free to use, modify, and redistribute.",
    "IS_LANTERN_FREE_ANSWER_2": "If your Internet connection has a data limit, then giving access through Lantern will be included in your usage.",
    "SAFE_TO_PROVIDE_ACCESS_QUESTION": "Is it safe for me to use Lantern to provide access to the Internet?",
    "SAFE_TO_PROVIDE_ACCESS_ANSWER_1": "For users with unrestricted Internet access in the uncensored world running as access points, Lantern currently allows other people to access any site on the internet via your connection, including ones that you may disagree with or that may be illegal in your jurisdiction. In future releases of Lantern, those giving access will be able to limit which sites other people can access via their internet connection.",

    "LANTERN_CLOUD_SERVERS_1": "Lantern Cloud Servers are small Amazon <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud\">EC2 instances</a> that serve as fallbacks when there are not enough peer users online.",
    "LANTERN_CLOUD_SERVERS_2": "This ensures that people will be able to get connected, even if a friend is not online. They help make the Lantern Network much more robust.",
    "LANTERN_CLOUD_SERVERS_3": "Unfortunately these servers cost money to maintain, so Brave New Software, the organization behind Lantern, can only supply a limited number of them. If you would like to help you can soon sponsor your own Lantern Cloud Server at <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://rally.org\">http://rally.org</a> (coming soon) If you are in a censored country this provides direct access for you and your friends. And its a great way to give from uncensored countries, increasing the reliability of the Lantern Network.",

    "GET_INVOLVED_2": "使用和传播 Lantern",
    "GET_INVOLVED_3": "If you have an uncensored internet connection, you can make a difference simply by keeping Lantern running. Every additional user sharing her connection makes the Lantern network work that much better, and that much harder to block for censors.",
    "GET_INVOLVED_4": "Whether or not you have an uncensored internet connection, you can also help by inviting people you trust to join the Lantern network. Lantern relies on a large network of users who trust one another to share internet connections, so the more trusted connections in the network, the better Lantern will work.
